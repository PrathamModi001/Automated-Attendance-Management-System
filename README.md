# Automated Attendance Management System

## Abstract

In todayâ€™s technologically advanced world, many organizations and institutions rely heavily on attendance management. Manually recording attendance using traditional methods takes a lot of time and is prone to error. We have created a system that uses face detection and recognition methods for automated attendance management to solve this problem. This README provides an extensive overview of the project, detailing its methodology, execution, and results. Our system automatically records student attendance in a classroom setting, offering teachers easy access to student data.
